This project requires Node.js and the following libraries to be installed: Express, and Require.

To run Node.js server using GitBash (Windows):
  1. Navigate into the main project folder
  2. Use the command "node server.js" to start the server (you should see the message "Server is up and running")
  3. Open Google Chrome and go to the url: "localhost:3000"
  4. You should see my project!

But wait, there are some bugs! One big one, really.
 1. If you search for a word that doesn't exist, the server will crash
   - I'm still a student at Grand Circus and we haven't gone over error handling yet.
   - This is something I will be able to do by December 15th (Graduation day).
   - Just re-type 'node server.js' into GitBash to get the server up and running again.

Acknowledgements:
